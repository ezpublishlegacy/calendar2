STEP BY STEP INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) Install the extention

Copy or extract the extension "calendar2" into your
extension folder of your eZ Publish installation.

2) Add 2 DB tables

The file

extension/calendar2/doc/calendar2.sql

contains 2 DB tables that you need to add to
your eZ Publish database. Run following command:

ez_root$> mysql -u <user> -p <my db name> < extension/calendar2/doc/calendar2.sql


3) Enable the extension

Enable the "calendar2" extension. In most cases you
enable it in

settings/override/site.ini.append.php

[ExtensionSettings]
ActiveExtensions[]=calendar2

4) Add override rules to your public facing siteaccess (settings/siteaccess/<siteaccess name>/override.ini.append.php):

[full_calendar2]
Source=node/view/full.tpl
MatchFile=full/calendar2.tpl
Subdir=templates
Match[class_identifier]=calendar2

[full_calendar2event]
Source=node/view/full.tpl
MatchFile=full/calendar2event.tpl
Subdir=templates
Match[class_identifier]=calendar2event


5) Cache and autoloads

Clear all cache and rebuild autoload array

ez_root$> php bin/php/ezcache --clear-all
ez_root$> php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e


6) Install the calendar2 package

Go to setup / packages

Import a new package and select the file in
extension/calendar2/doc/calendar2.ezpkg

It's going to add 3 new content classes that are
required.

Make sure to hit the install button.

Note that if you have errors on importing the package, you might need to use the included v7.php to patch your eZ Components install.
Overwrite the file in Archive/src/tar/v7.php with the version included in this install.
For some background on the package issue, see http://issues.ez.no/IssueView.php?Id=16822

Note also that the classes in the package will be installed in the language eng-US.
Translate the class to another language if desired, especially if you are using a single-language install in a language other than eng-US.

7) Change user permissions

Edit the anonymous user role

Add a new policy and select the "calendar2"
module. Grant access to all function for that
module.

8) Enable the workflows

Under Setup / Workflows, create two new workflows.
#1: Name it "Update event table" and select the event "updateeventtable".
Save the workflow and enable it under Setup / Triggers
(content / publish / after AND content / hide / after ).
#2: Name it "Remove events from table" and select the event "removeevent"
Save the workflow and enable it under Setup / Triggers
(content / delete / before ).

9) Enable JavaScript and CSS
The extension expects that you are using ezjscore. If you are not
you should do the following:
If you do not have automatic loading of CSS and JS files
listed in design.ini, manually add the JS files in
extension/calendar2/settings/design.ini.append.php to your
page head.
Also, add the stylesheets from
extension/calendar2/design/standard/stylesheets/
to your page head.
Also, remove the ezcss_require calls from
extension/calendar2/design/standard/override/templates/full/calendar2.tpl

10) Create a folder to contain event categories.
Enter the node ID of that folder in [Calendar]CategoriesFolderNodeID in calendar2.ini.append.php
Also, edit the Category Event class and select that folder under the Categories object relations attribute.
Categories are required -- every event must have a category.

You are done with the installation - see the user
manual for an example of how to use calendar2
